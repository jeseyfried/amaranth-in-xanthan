<h2>3D Printing using Orca Slicer (software app) and the Anycubic Kobra 3 Printer (hardware)</h2>

<p>The slicing software creates instructions for how to print an object for a particular printer. On the Mac workstations in the History Tech Lab, the software is set to default to the printer we have: the Anycubic Kobra 3. If you want to slice a model on your own computer, choose the correct version of Orca to download by visiting <a href="https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases">their Github page</a>. You can choose which of the four loaded filaments you want to use for your print. Watch these videos for helpful step-by-step tutorials.</p>

<h2>Tips for Preparing the Print File</h2>
+ Open the Orca Slicer application and import an STL file. 
+ After rotating it and snapping it to the build plate, it should look like what you see in the image below.

+ Adjust the dimensions and any other print settings.
+ Then click 'Sice plate' at the top of the screen.<br>
+ Make sure that the file is saved in the file type '.gcode' and after the slicing completes it should look like the image below.

<h2>Starting the Print</h2>

+ Save the .gcode file to a USB drive and then insert that drive into the port on the Anycubic Kobra 3 printer. 
+ Before printing, check:
  1. That the nozzle is clear of any filament buildup
  2. That the tubes do not contain any breaks in the filament
+ Use the touchpad to select your print file from the USB drive.
+ Watch the printing for at least the first two layers of the object.
+ Cancel the print if:
  1. The filament fails to load
  2. The filament begins to bubble over the nozzle
  3. The filament fails to adhere to the build plate
+ After the first two layers have printed successfully, you can leave the printer and return when the print is completed.
+ Make a note to yourself, such as through setting a reminder on your phone, when to return to pick up the completed print and turn off the printer.
