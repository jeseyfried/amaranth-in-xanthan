<h2>3D Terrain and Friction Maps</h2>

This use case includes printing basic terrain as well as exploring additional 3D features to represent borderlands concepts.

<h2>Recommendations for 3D Printing Terrain</h2>

For a quick way to obtain a STL file for terrain, go to <a href="https://touchterrain.geol.iastate.edu/main">Touch Terrain</a> created by Iowa State University.

<h2>Use Multicolor Mode to Create Visible Layers</h2>

The 3D printer in Amaranth supports multi-colored printing. This can be done by layer, so as to further illustrate elevation and topography.
