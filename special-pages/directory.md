There are two kinds of directory pages, which you can find in your home folder:

## directory-gs
The [directory-gs](../directory-gs) page shows how to create directory cards where the data comes from a Google Sheet. This is good for when there are many people creating their own cards at once, or for directory pages with lots of cards.

## directory-yml
The [directory-yml](../directory-yml) page shows how to create directory cards where the data comes from the YML header at the top of the page. This is good for when there are only a handful of directory items and don't change very often. 


If you want a directory page at all, you'll probably want to rename one or both of these. Of course you can have multiple directory pages for different items.
