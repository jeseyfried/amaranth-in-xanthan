<h2>The ONE X2 by Insta360</h2>
Amaranth owns a 360 video camera which can also be used for 360 photos. The model is the ONE X2 by Insta360.

For full instructions and documentation visit the <a href="https://onlinemanual.insta360.com/onex2/en-us/camera/basic">support page</a> for the Insta360 ONE X2 camera.

<h2>Recording Video</h2>
+ Start recording a video by simply clicking the button on the camera.
+ After recording, connect the camera through a USB-C cable to one of the Mac workstations in the Lab.

<h2>Editing a 360 Video</h2>
+ Open the application Insta360 Studio.
+ The video below provides you with an excellent tutorial for editing a 360 video.

<h2>Creating a 360 Photo</h2>
+ The process for a 360 photo differs from a video since there's only one frame you can't edit yourself out.
+ For a 360 photo without the person taking the photo appearing in it, download the Insta360 app to your phone and connect to the camera through bluetooth.
+ Use the app on your phone to take the photo as you stand out of view.
+ After connecting the camera to the Mac workstation, you can export the photo from Insta360 Studio.

<h2>Adding Info Hotspots to a 360 Photo</h2>
+ Unfortunately, the Insta360 Studio app does not have the capability to include info hotspots on a 360 photo. You will need to use a web-app called <a href="https://www.marzipano.net">Marzipano</a>.
+ Export the 360 photo from Insta360 Studio as a JPG file.
+ Upload the JPG to Marzipano and add info hotspots. This is a user-friendly process on the Marzipano web-app interface.
+ The only export format allowed from Marzipano is a zipped folder. The folder will likely contain over 100 files and this quantity might cause complications when trying to upload to spaces such as Github. We have a workaround for this if you need help.
