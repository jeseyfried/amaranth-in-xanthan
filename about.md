# Mission
Our mission is to harness innovative digital technologies and digital design to illuminate the rich history of New Mexico. We empower scholars, educators, and communities to create immersive, interactive archives and storytelling experiences that invite critical engagement with core humanities issues. Through collaborative projects, open-access resources, and experimental digital platforms, we aim to bridge academic research with public discourse, fostering a deeper, more inclusive understanding of the human condition.

## What is Amaranth?
Xanthan is a simple static website template that facilitates making a website that is hosted for free, always accessible, and easy to update via GitHub Pages. 

It provides a number of features for digital storytelling with a Story Map-like interface. 

It's low-ish tech, which means that changes are a bit more technical than just editing a web form like on Wix or Squarespace. But no real technical skills are required.
