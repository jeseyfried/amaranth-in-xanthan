<h2>Tips for 3D Scanning</h2>
+ Open the Revoscan application on the computer and connect the scanner through its USB cable. The setup should look like the picture below.

Scanning Every Surface
+ After completing separate scans for each rotated side of the object, you will have multiple scan files listed on the lefthand side of the application screen.
+ Go through each of these and delete unwanted material. In the example in the picture below, we would next delete the ring around the base of the object.

Fusion and Merging
+ Click through the Fusion instructions for each of the scans.
+ Once fused, the multiple scans can then be merged.
+ Check that enough of the model (over 30%) overlaps, such as in the image below.

Merging and Exporting the Model
+ Click 'Generate Model.'
+ After merging, you can create the Mesh for the object.
+ Check your object for holes to fill erroneous extra material.
+ Choose which type of file format for your Export:
  1. For 3D printing, export in STL format
  2. For viewing in 3D in a virtual environment on the internet, choose GLTF format
